# System Workflow

The AI-Powered Fake News Detector follows this sequential workflow:

1. **User Input**
   - User submits a news claim or query
   - Input is validated and preprocessed

2. **Claim History Check**
   - System checks internal database for similar claims
   - Retrieves previous verdicts and timestamps

3. **Parallel Information Gathering**
   - Web Search: Uses DuckDuckGo API to find related articles
   - Trend Analysis: Assesses claim's current popularity
   - Both processes run simultaneously for efficiency

4. **Credibility Scoring**
   - Evaluates trustworthiness of sources
   - Applies custom scoring algorithm
   - Considers multiple factors for reliability

5. **Data Aggregation**
   - Combines results from all sources
   - Structures data for LLM processing
   - Includes timestamps and metadata

6. **LLM Processing**
   - Analyzes aggregated data
   - Generates final verdict
   - Provides supporting context

7. **User Feedback**
   - Presents verdict to user
   - Collects feedback on accuracy
   - Updates system knowledge base

8. **Database Update**
   - Records new verdict
   - Stores user feedback
   - Updates claim history
